# 🏗️ Architecture — Layer 1: SOPs

> Technical Standard Operating Procedures written in Markdown.  
> Define goals, inputs, tool logic, and edge cases.

## 📏 The Golden Rule

> **If logic changes, update the SOP here BEFORE updating the code in `tools/`.**

_SOPs will be created during Phase 3 (Architect)._
