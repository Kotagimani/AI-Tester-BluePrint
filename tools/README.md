# 🔧 Tools — Layer 3: Execution Scripts

> Deterministic Python scripts. Atomic and testable.  
> Each tool does ONE thing and is independently testable.

## Rules

- Environment variables/tokens stored in `.env`
- Use `.tmp/` for all intermediate file operations
- No hardcoded secrets

---

_Tools will be created during Phase 3 (Architect), AFTER the Blueprint is approved._
